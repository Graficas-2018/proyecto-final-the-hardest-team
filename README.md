# Assignment 6 Crossy road clone

Assignment No 6 for the computer graphics course. 

Based on the Class demos, create a [Crossy Road](https://poki.com/en/g/crossy-road) clone. The game must have:

1. A score, which increases with every step forward you character takes. The character can move left, right, or forward.
2. It must have different sections: land with trees, a road through which vehicles are moving, and water with logs.
3. Each element must have its collider and it has to interact with the character: trees block it, vehicles crash with it, and logs are used to support it and keep it from drowning in the water. Logs also move along the water section.
4. You must include at least 5 different sections that the character has to traverse, with at least 3 being one land, one road, and one water.
5. The character, trees, logs, and vehicles do not necessarily have to be 3D models, they can be cubes with different dimensions.
6. The objective of the game is for the character to go from the first tile, to the last.
7. Extra points for creating an "infinite" game: tiles are added indefinetely as the character moves through them.

Rubric:

1. At least 5 sections are included.
2. Colliders work in the expected way.
3. The different sections have complete functionality.
4. The character moves correctly, and the score increases when it moves forward.
5. The game restarts when the character reaches the last tile.
